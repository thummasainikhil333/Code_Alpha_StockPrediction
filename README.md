In the scope of this project, I created a stock price prediction model by implementing LSTM model in Jupyter notebook. While processing the historical data, the application predicts future stock prices adhering to the requirements of data preprocessing, LSTM architecture, and visualizing the results. The LSTM model is trained on the past stock movements and can give the investor an indication of what to expect in the future.
